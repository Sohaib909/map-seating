# Interactive Event Seating Map

This application uses React 19 with TypeScript (strict mode) and SVG rendering to support interactive seat selection for venues with up to 15,000 seats. The architecture prioritizes performance through memoization (React.memo on Seat components), normalized state for O(1) lookups, and hardware-accelerated SVG over Canvas. State management uses custom hooks (useSeatSelection, useVenue) rather than external libraries to keep the bundle small. The choice of SVG enables accessibility (each seat is a focusable DOM element with ARIA labels) and declarative event handling, though Canvas would be more performant for venues exceeding 50k seats. localStorage provides persistence across sessions but selections aren't shareable via URL. No virtualization is implemented since the current approach handles 15k seats smoothly on mid-range hardware. The heat map toggle allows users to switch between status-based coloring and price tier visualization. An adjacent seat finder searches for N consecutive available seats and provides navigation through multiple matching results.

Incomplete features include WebSocket integration for live seat status updates, touch gestures (pinch-zoom/pan) for mobile, dark mode theming, and end-to-end tests with Playwright. The current implementation focuses on core seat selection functionality with full keyboard navigation, price tier heat map visualization, adjacent seat finding, and WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.

To run the application: `pnpm install && pnpm dev` (starts at http://localhost:5173). To run tests: `pnpm test` for watch mode, `npx vitest run` for CI mode, or `pnpm test:coverage` for coverage reports. The test suite includes 41 test cases across 7 files covering hooks (useSeatSelection, useVenue) and components (Seat, SeatMap, SeatDetails, SelectionSummary, Legend, App), verifying functionality, accessibility, keyboard navigation, and error handling.
